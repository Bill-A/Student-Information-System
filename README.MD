## Student Information System
#### Goal: 
- This repo is all about learning. The topic is Test-Driven Development (TDD). We will be using Jeff Langr's book, *Agile Java*: [http://langrsoft.com/books-2/#agileJava]. 
- We will examine how to integrate Java and TDD  throughout the entire development lifecycle, while helping to leverage efficient development techniques. We investigate how to translate oral requirements into practical tests, and then how to use those tests to create reliable, high-performance Java code that solves real problems.

- Additionally, we will gain experience using Gradle and Jenkins!
